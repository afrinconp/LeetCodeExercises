# LeetCodeExercises
In this repository I show some of the solutions of the leetcode excerises from the webiste:  [LeetCode](https://pages.github.com/) that I have made. I decided to solve just for fun and in order to improve my code skills. Feel free to comment if you have any other solution for one of the problems (I'd be really grateful if you summited a code, which takes less time)
